gives you two 'legacy' code bases and has you fix a few bugs

# Football Scores App Api Key

The football scores app requires an api key to communicate with
the api service. I have extracted that api key to a gradle
property variable. You will need to have a gradle.properties
file in your ~/.gradle directory and in that file you will need
to have a line in the file that looks like this:
FOOTBALL_SCORES_API_KEY=your_api_key
